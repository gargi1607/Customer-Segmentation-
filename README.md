# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior so businesses can understand different customer types and target them effectively.

Customer segmentation helps in:

- Personalized marketing  
- Improving customer retention  
- Increasing sales  
- Better business decision-making  

---

## 🎯 Objective

To segment customers into different clusters based on features like:

- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  

Using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into K clusters based on similarity.

Steps involved:

1. Choose number of clusters (K)  
2. Initialize centroids  
3. Assign data points to nearest centroid  
4. Update centroids  
5. Repeat until convergence  

---

## 📊 Visualization

The clusters are visualized using scatter plots where:

- Each color represents a different customer group  
- Centroids are clearly marked  

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
